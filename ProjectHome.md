SvnX is an OS X open source GUI for most features of the svn client binary.

It allows you to browse your working copies, spot changes and operate on them but also to browse logs and revisions of your repositories.

It's written using Panther's new bindings mechanism for maximum flexibility and user experience.

SvnX is brought to you by [La Chose Interactive](http://www.lachoseinteractive.net).
