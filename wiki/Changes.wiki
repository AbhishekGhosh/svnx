  * Updated Sparkle Plus to version 96.
  * Fixed : reverted the ability to rename (renamable!) files in hierarchical mode.

==== 0.9.10 ====
  * New bullet-proof parsing method for svn status that uses --xml output. Requires a subversion 1.4 client. Can be disabled in the preferences.
  * Added a tooltip that explains the meaning of the columns’ characters.
  * Added a thin vertical separator in working copy browser.
  * Added a basic warning if svn is not found in the path that it set in preferences. (Thanks vskbros).
  * Applied <a href="http://svnx.lachoseinteractive.net/ticket/84">patch</a> by robbie from prelab.net to fix diff issue.

==== 0.9.8 ====
  * Rewrote the broken file history panel !AppleScript invocation from scratch.

  * Support for BBEdit diff.
  * Implemented auto-update with Sparkle Plus.
  * “Reveal In Finder” now opens the root directory of the local repository if no file/folder is selected in the Working copy list.

==== 0.9.7 ====
  * Now compiled as Universal Binary.
  * In the repository window, the url is now clickable : you can now click a segment of the url to browse an upper level of the repository.

  * Fixed : in old revisions, could not browse paths that had been moved or deleted. Now use path@revision syntax in svn list, svn checkout & svn export.
  * Fixed : svnX now properly closes the pipes it opens.

  * Integrates a patch by Yuichi Fujishige that should provide better support for UTF-16 strings. Should fix the log file stall issue.
  * Diff comparisons should no longer be messed up when launched several at time (thanks James Dessart).
  * The temp file diff compares against is now given the same extension, so !FileMerge coloring (from XCode 2.1) is right.
  * Fixed “svn resolved” issue.

==== 0.9.5 ====
  * Fixed export of a single non-directory item by drag&drop that was broken in 0.9.4.

==== 0.9.4 ====
  * Preliminary support for diff applications other than !FileMerge. Added !TextWrangler and !CodeWarrior as possible choice in general preferences. <br/>(thanks to <a href="http://www.rogue-research.com" target="_blank">Sean !McBride</a> for the modified script!).
